For the eclectic look, I will bring out green printed plates and contrast it with my blue tall glasses and place them on a red placemat. The burst of colours is going to be a cheerful surprise for the spouse during my special Eid breakfast. My son, who is not obliging towards my crazy ideas, will have a casual setting with his favourite blue recycle glass plate and a short yellow glass. I will go for my vintage look, white plate in blue prints bordered in gold, a white lace cotton napkin, and my cherished Villeroy and Boch cutlery.
